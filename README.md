# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
For this project I was able to apply web scraping methods to extract information from the NASA Science Mars Exploration website. I used Chrome Developer tools to identify HTML components, Beautiful Soup/Splinter to automate a web browser and perform the scrape, MongoDB to store the data, and Flask to create a web application to display the data.
